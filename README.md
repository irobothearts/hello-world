# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository; I have no idea what I'm doing yet,  but this seems exciting!

I'm now going to make some edits, to test exactly how branching, edits and commits work. I'm guessing I could fill this with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PYTHON/PHP or any other code and anyone I wanted to work with could help edit and build a project with me. That's fantastic. Now I need to learn to code!!
